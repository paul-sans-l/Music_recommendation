NOTE THAT : This program was not meant to be used by anyone else than me, Thus I removed my APIs Key. To fetch the tracks seeds,
the app fetches MY SEEDS playlist, Therefore if you still want to use my program make sure to replace "MY_SEEDS_PLAYLIST_ID" in recommending's "getSimilarFromSeeds()" method.
